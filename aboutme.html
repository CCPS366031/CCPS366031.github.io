<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>1. I am working towards staying on track at my job and keep earning money to pay for a place to stay after I graduate. I also am still playing baseball and am planning to play it in college so I need to keep working at that. I have played baseball since I was five and have been working at Pelican Bay Golf Course for a couple months now.

2. I am working and practicing every week to keep earning money and keep getting better. I am very dedicated and focused on getting to where I want to be.

3. I consider dedication and hard work the two major factors in being successful because without those you wont be able to get anywhere in anything you do.

4. I would like to finish senior year with good grades and keep boosting my gpa to apply for colleges and get accepted.

5. I want to be known as a hard worker and always putting forth 100% effort on everything I do. I want to be known as a trustworthy person that you can ask do do something and you know it will be done and done right.</p>
